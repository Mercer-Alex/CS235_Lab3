like them here or there I would not like them here or there I would not like them anywhere I do so like green eggs and ham Thank you Thank you SamIam Every Who Down in Whoville Liked Christmas a lot But the GrinchWho lived just north of Whoville Did NOT The Grinch hated Christmas The whole Christmas season Now please dont ask why No one quite knows the reason It could be his head wasnt screwed on just right It could be perhaps that his shoes were too tight But I think that the most likely reason of all May have been that his heart was two sizes too small Whatever the reason His heart or his shoes He stood there on Christmas Eve hating the Whos Staring down from his cave with a sour Grinchy frown At the warm lighted windows below in their town For he knew every Who down in Whoville beneath Was busy now hanging a mistletoe wreath And theyre hanging their stockings he snarled with a sneer Tomorrow is Christmas Its practically here Then he growled with his Grinch fingers nervously drumming I MUST find some way to stop Christmas from coming For Tomorrow he knew all the Who girls and boys Would wake bright and early Theyd rush for their toys And then Oh the noise Oh the Noise Noise Noise Noise Thats one thing he hated The NOISE NOISE NOISE NOISE Then the Whos young and old would sit down to a feast And theyd feast And theyd feast And theyd FEAST FEAST FEAST FEAST They would feast on Whopudding and rare Whoroast beast Which was something the Grinch couldnt stand in the least And THEN Theyd do something He liked least of all Every Who down in Whoville the tall and the small Would stand close together with Christmas bells ringing Theyd stand handinhand And the Whos would start singing Theyd sing And theyd sing And theyd SING SING SING SING And the more the Grinch thought of this Who ChristmasSing The more the Grinch thought I must stop this whole thing Why for fiftythree years Ive put up with it now I MUST stop this Christmas from coming But HOW Then he got an idea An awful idea THE GRINCH GOT A WONDERFUL AWFUL IDEA I know just what to do The Grinch laughed in his throat And he made a quick Santy Claus hat and a coat And he chuckled and clucked What a great Grinchy trick With this coat and this hat I look just like Saint Nick All I need is a reindeer The Grinch looked around But since reindeer are scarce there was none to be found Did that stop the old Grinch No The Grinch simply said If I cant find a reindeer Ill make one instead So he called his dog Max Then he took some red thread And he tied a big horn on the top of his head THEN He loaded some bags And some old empty sacks On a ramshackle sleigh And he hitched up old Max Then the Grinch said Giddap And the sleigh started down Toward the homes where the Whos Lay asnooze in their town All their windows were dark Quiet snow filled the air All the Whos were all dreaming sweet dreams without care When he came to the first little house on the square This is stop number one the old Grinchy Claus hissed And he climbed to the roof empty bags in his fist Then he slid down the chimney A rather tight pinch But if Santa could do it then so could the Grinch He got stuck only once for a moment or two Then he stuck his head out of the fireplace flue Where the little Who stockings all hung in a row These stockings he grinned are the first things to go Then he slithered and slunk with a smile most unpleasant Around the whole room and he took every present Pop guns And bicycles Roller skates Drums Checkerboards Tricycles Popcorn And plums And he stuffed them in bags Then the Grinch very nimbly Stuffed all the bags one by one up the chimney Then he slunk to the icebox He took the Whos feast He took the Whopudding He took the roast beast He cleaned out that icebox as quick as a flash Why that Grinch even took their last can of Whohash Then he stuffed all the food up the chimney with glee And NOW grinned the Grinch I will stuff up the tree And the Grinch grabbed the tree and he started to shove When he heard a small sound like the coo of a dove He turned around fast and he saw a small Who Little CindyLou Who who was not more than two The Grinch had been caught by this tiny Who daughter Whod got out of bed for a cup of cold water She stared at the Grinch and said Santy Claus why Why are you taking our Christmas tree WHY But you know that old Grinch was so smart and so slick He thought up a lie and he thought it up quick Why my sweet little tot the fake Santy Claus lied Theres a light on this tree that wont light on one side So Im taking it home to my workshop my dear Ill fix it up there Then Ill bring it back here And his fib fooled the child Then he patted her head And he got her a drink and he sent her to bed And when CindyLou Who went to bed with her cup HE went to the chimney and stuffed the tree up Then the last thing he took Was the log for their fire Then he went up the chimney himself the old liar On their walls he left nothing but hooks and some wire And the one speck of food That he left in the house Was a crumb that was even too small for a mouse Then He did the same thing To the other Whos houses Leaving crumbs Much too small For the other Whos mouses It was quarter past dawn All the Whos still abed All the Whos still asnooze When he packed up his sled Packed it up with their presents The ribbons The wrappings The tags And the tinsel The trimmings The trappings Three thousand feet up Up the side of Mt Crumpit He rode with his load to the tiptop to dump it PoohPooh to the Whos he was grinchishly humming Theyre finding out now that no Christmas is coming Theyre just waking up I know just what theyll do Their mouths will hang open a minute or two Then the Whos down in Whoville will all cry BooHoo Thats a noise grinned the Grinch That I simply MUST hear So he paused And the Grinch put his hand to his ear And he did hear a sound rising over the snow It started in low Then it started to grow But the sound wasnt sad Why this sound sounded merry It couldnt be so But it WAS merry VERY He stared down at Whoville The Grinch popped his eyes Then he shook What he saw was a shocking surprise Every Who down in Whoville the tall and the small Was singing Without any presents at all He HADNT stopped Christmas from coming IT CAME Somehow or other it came just the same And the Grinch with his grinchfeet icecold in the snow Stood puzzling and puzzling How could it be so It came with out ribbons It came without tags It came without packages boxes or bags And he puzzled three hours till his puzzler was sore Then the Grinch thought of something he hadnt before Maybe Christmas he thought doesnt come from a store Maybe Christmasperhapsmeans a little bit more And what happened then Wellin Whoville they say That the Grinchs small heart Grew three sizes that day And the minute his heart didnt feel quite so tight He whizzed with his load through the bright morning light And he brought back the toys And the food for the feast And he HE HIMSELF The Grinch carved the roast beast Oh Where will you go Where will you choose There are places to stand when you stay in your shoes Some of the places are comboozled and bad Those are the places that just make you sad They dont dress all the way They even blow smoke They drink icky drinks that will just make you choke But these are the places youll know not to choose for these are the places that will just make you lose There are good places to stand so decide with great care when you find on thats holy Go and stand there Standing alone can make you feel small but when standing for truth youll stand tallest of all Carry your values theyll help you to know when you should stand and when you should go Go find holy places Go find your way Stand up and stand tall And go stand there today The more that you read the more things you will know The more that you learn the more places youll go The sun did not shine It was too wet to play So we sat in the house All that cold cold wet day I sat there with Sally We sat there we two And I said How I wish We had something to do Too wet to go out And too cold to play ball So we sat in the house We did nothing at all So all we could do was to Sit Sit Sit Sit And we did not like it Not one little bit And then Something went BUMP How that bump made us jump We looked Then we saw him step in on the mat We looked And we saw him The Cat in the Hat And he said to us Why do you sit there like that I know it is wet And the sun is not sunny But we can have Lots of good fun that is funny I know some good games we could play Said the cat I know some new tricks Said the Cat in the Hat A lot of good tricks I will show them to you Your mother Will not mind at all if I do Then Sally and I Did not know what to say Our mother was out of the house For the day Through the years while my buildings have fallen apart Ive worried about it with all of my heart But now says the Onceler Now that youre here the word of the Lorax seems perfectly clear Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot nothing is going to get better Its not Do you like Green eggs and ham I do not like them SamIam I do not like Green eggs and ham Would you like them Here or there I would not like them Here or there I would not like them Anywhere I do not like Green eggs and ham I do not like them SamIam Would you like them In a house Would you like them With a mouse I do not like them In a house I do not like them With a mouse I do not like them Here or there I do not like them Anywhere I do not like green eggs and ham I do not like them SamIam Would you eat them In a box Would you eat them With a fox Not in a box Not with a fox Not in a house Not with a mouse I would not eat them here or there I would not eat them anywhere I would not eat green eggs and ham I do not like them SamIam Im Yertle the Turtle Oh marvelous me For I am the ruler of all that I see Your Majesty Please I dont like to complain But down here below we are feeling great pain And the turtles of course All the turtles are free As turtles and maybe all creatures should be Now the StarBell Sneetches had bellies with stars The PlainBelly Sneetches had none upon thars Those stars werent so big They were really so small You might think such a thing wouldnt matter at all But because they had stars all the StarBelly Sneetches Would brag Were the best kind of Sneetch on the beaches With their snoots in the air they would sniff and theyd snort Well have nothing to do with the PlainBelly sort And whenever they met some when they were out walking Theyd hike right on past them without even talking Did I ever tell you that Mrs McCave Had twentythree sons and she named them all Dave Well she did And that wasnt a smart thing to do You see when she wants one and calls out YooHoo Come into the house Dave she doesnt get one All twentythree Daves of hers come on the run This makes things quite difficult at the McCaves As you can imagine with so many Daves And often she wishes that when they were born She had named one of them Bodkin Van Horn And one of them HoosFoos And one of them Snimm And one of them HotShot And one Sunny Jim Another one PuttPutt Another one Moon Face Another one Marvin OGravel Balloon Face And one of them Zanzibar BuckBuck McFate But she didnt do it And now its too late If your daddys name is Jim and if Jim swims and if Jims slim the perfect Christmas gift for him is a set of Slim Jim Swim Fins But if your daddys name is Dwight and he likes to look at birds at night the gift for Dwight that might be right is a
